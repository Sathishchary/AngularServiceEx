# Project Structure Overview

This document outlines the key files and directories of this Angular application, providing a brief description of their purpose.

## Root Directory

-   **.angular-cli.json**: (Likely `.angular.json` in more recent Angular versions) The configuration file for the Angular CLI. It defines project settings, build options, proxy configurations, and more.
-   **.editorconfig**: Configuration file for code editors to maintain consistent coding styles (e.g., indentation, line endings) across different editors and IDEs.
-   **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts).
-   **README.md**: Contains introductory information about the project, setup instructions, and other relevant details.
-   **karma.conf.js**: Configuration file for the Karma test runner, used for running unit tests.
-   **package.json**: Standard Node.js manifest file. It lists project dependencies (both for the application and for development), as well as scripts for building, testing, serving, and other development tasks (e.g., `npm start`, `npm test`).
-   **protractor.conf.js**: Configuration file for Protractor, an end-to-end test framework for Angular applications.
-   **tsconfig.json**: The root TypeScript configuration file. It specifies compiler options for the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Often, this file is extended by more specific `tsconfig` files within the `src` directory.
-   **tslint.json**: Configuration file for TSLint, a linter for TypeScript code to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors. (Note: TSLint is deprecated in favor of ESLint).

## `src/` Directory (Source Files)

This directory contains the actual source code of the Angular application.

-   **index.html**: The main HTML page that is served when someone visits the site. Angular bootstraps the application within this file, typically by adding the root component's selector (e.g., `<app-root>`) to the `<body>`.
-   **main.ts**: The main entry point for the application. It compiles the application with the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler and bootstraps the `AppModule` to run in the browser.
-   **polyfills.ts**: Imports scripts required to make Angular and its features compatible with older browsers that may not support all modern JavaScript APIs.
-   **styles.css** (or **styles.scss/less/styl**): Global stylesheets for the application. Styles defined here can affect the entire application.
-   **test.ts**: The main entry point for running unit tests. It configures the Angular testing environment.
-   **tsconfig.app.json**: TypeScript configuration specifically for the Angular application code. It typically extends the root `tsconfig.json`.
-   **tsconfig.spec.json**: TypeScript configuration specifically for the unit tests. It also extends the root `tsconfig.json`.
-   **typings.d.ts**: TypeScript declaration file. Used for providing TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries that don't have their own.

### `src/app/` Directory (Application Core)

This is where the core logic of the Angular application resides, including modules, components, services, and models.

-   **app.component.css** (or **.scss/less/styl**): Stylesheet specifically for `AppComponent`. These styles are typically scoped to the component.
-   **app.component.html**: The HTML template for `AppComponent`. It defines the structure and layout of the root component's view.
-   **app.component.spec.ts**: Unit tests for `AppComponent`.
-   **app.component.ts**: The main application component (the root component). It acts as the primary container for the application's views and logic.
-   **app.module.ts**: The main Angular module, often called the root module. It declares the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module, imports other modules, registers services, and defines the bootstrap component (`AppComponent`).

#### `src/app/models/` Directory

Contains data model definitions (classes or interfaces) used throughout the application.

-   **employee.ts**: Defines the structure of an `Employee` object (e.g., `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`).

#### `src/app/services/` Directory

Contains Angular services responsible for tasks like data fetching, business logic, logging, etc.

-   **reference.service.spec.ts**: Unit tests for `ReferenceService`.
-   **reference.service.ts**: A service responsible for fetching employee data, in this case, from `assets/service.json`.

### `src/assets/` Directory

Stores static assets that are copied as-is when the application is built.

-   **.gitkeep**: An empty file often used to ensure that Git tracks the directory even if it's otherwise empty.
-   **service.json**: A JSON file containing an array of employee data, acting as a mock backend or data source for the `ReferenceService`.

### `src/environments/` Directory

Contains environment-specific configuration files. This allows the application to behave differently in various environments (e.g., development, production).

-   **environment.prod.ts**: Configuration settings for the production environment (e.g., `production: true`, production API endpoints).
-   **environment.ts**: Configuration settings for the development environment (e.g., `production: false`, development API endpoints). The build system replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts` during a production build.

-   **favicon.ico**: The icon displayed in the browser tab or bookmarks.

## `e2e/` Directory (End-to-End Tests)

Contains files related to end-to-end (E2E) testing of the application, typically using Protractor.

-   **app.e2e-spec.ts**: An E2E test specification file. It defines test scenarios that simulate user interactions with the application in a real browser environment.
-   **app.po.ts**: A Page Object file for E2E tests. Page Objects help create maintainable E2E tests by encapsulating information about the elements on a page and the interactions with them.
-   **tsconfig.e2e.json**: TypeScript configuration specifically for the E2E tests.
